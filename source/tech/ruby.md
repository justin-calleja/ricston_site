## About ruby

Ruby is a multi-platform open-source dynamic object-oriented interpreted language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz) in 1993.

[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) is an open-source dynamic object-oriented interpreted language that combines the good bits from [Perl](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/perl/info), [Smalltalk](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/smalltalk/info) and [Lisp](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/lisp/info). It supports multiple programming paradigms including functional, object oriented and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management; it is therefore similar in varying respects to Smalltalk, Python, Perl, Lisp, Dylan, and CLU. Ruby's primary purpose is to ["help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEkJvvGEtB4) Ruby focuses on simplicity and productivity.

Ruby was initially conceived on February 24, 1993 by [Yukihiro Matsumoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) ('Matz') and version 1.0 was released in 1996\. Ruby's mindshare spiked around 2005 due to [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), an MVC (Model, View, Controller) framework for building web applications and usage continues to grow as of 2015 with Ruby continuing to find acceptance in the commercial marketplace. The current stable version is 2.2.

The [ruby](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby "show questions tagged 'ruby'") tag is for questions related to:

*   the Ruby language,
*   Ruby syntax,
*   Ruby libraries, and
*   anything Ruby-related except Ruby on Rails.

Tag questions specifically about the [Ruby on Rails](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/ruby-on-rails/info) framework with the [ruby-on-rails](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails "show questions tagged 'ruby-on-rails'") tag, not [ruby](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby "show questions tagged 'ruby'").
