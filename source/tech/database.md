## About database

A database is an organized collection of data typically used to model certain situations. Use this tag if you have questions about designing a database. If it is about a particular database management system, (e.g., MySQL), please use that tag instead.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database):

> A database is an organized collection of data. The data is typically organized to model relevant aspects of reality (for example, the availability of rooms in hotels), in a way that supports processes requiring this information (for example, finding a hotel with vacancies).

A large proportion of websites and applications rely on databases. They are a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstraction, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.<sup>[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language)</sup>

A [Data Manipulation Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language) ([dml](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dml "show questions tagged 'dml'")) is used to affect the contents of the database. The most widely used [dml](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dml "show questions tagged 'dml'") is [sql](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sql "show questions tagged 'sql'").

The term _database_ should not be confused with _[Database Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_management_system)_ (DBMS). A [dbms](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dbms "show questions tagged 'dbms'") is the system software used to create and manage databases and provide users and applications with access to the database(s). A database is to a DBMS as a document is to a word processor.
