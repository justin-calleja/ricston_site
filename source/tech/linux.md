## About linux

GNU/Linux, commonly shortened as Linux, is an open source operating system. Use this tag only if your question relates to using Linux APIs or Linux-specific behavior. Questions relating to using or troubleshooting Linux are off topic.

**GNU/Linux** is a Unix-like computer operating system which consists of necessary user-space libraries and programs provided by [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/) in Cambridge, Massachusetts and a kernel, developed by Linus Torvalds in Helsinki, Finland.

The GNU/Linux naming controversy is a dispute among members of the free and open source software community over how to refer to the computer operating system commonly called Linux.

## Design

A GNU/Linux-based system is a modular Unix-like operating system. It derives much of its basic design from principles established in Unix during the 1970s and 1980s. Such a system uses a monolithic kernel which handles process control, networking, and peripheral and file system access. Device drivers are either integrated directly with the kernel or added as modules loaded while the system is running.

Separate projects that interface with the kernel provide much of the system's higher-level functionality. The GNU user-land is an important part of most GNU/Linux-based systems, providing the most common implementation of the C library, a popular shell, and many of the common Unix tools which carry out many basic operating system tasks. The graphical user interface (or GUI) used by most GNU/Linux systems is built on top of an implementation of the X Window System.

### Tag Usage

The [linux](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/linux "show questions tagged 'linux'") tag on Stack Overflow is generally used for questions about:

*   programming against the APIs supplied by the operating system
*   the implementation of the kernel
*   programming tools and techniques for use _on_ a GNU/Linux system.

Notable questions that probably don't belong are:

*   questions about using a desktop or laptop GNU/Linux system are better directed towards [Super User](https://superuser.com/)
*   questions about administering GNU/Linux systems for other users and networking GNU/Linux systems in a context more complicated then a minimal home network are better directed towards [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/).

Many questions about GNU/Linux can _also_ be properly tagged as [unix](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/unix "show questions tagged 'unix'"), but some features are specific to GNU/Linux and are not found on other Unixâ„¢ and Unix-like operating systems. If you have questions about a specific distribution and version (e.g. [ubuntu-14.04](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ubuntu-14.04 "show questions tagged 'ubuntu-14.04'"), it may not be necessary to use this tag for that question.

A fair number of [linux](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/linux "show questions tagged 'linux'") questions are really questions about the command shell (`bash` by default on many systems), and are probably better tagged with [shell](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/shell "show questions tagged 'shell'") and/or the particular shell you are interested in ([bash](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bash "show questions tagged 'bash'"), [zsh](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/zsh "show questions tagged 'zsh'"), [tcsh](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tcsh "show questions tagged 'tcsh'"), etc...).

Questions about the internals of the GNU/Linux kernel or regarding writing GNU/Linux kernel modules should be tagged [linux-kernel](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/linux-kernel "show questions tagged 'linux-kernel'").
