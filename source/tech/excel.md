## About excel

Use the Excel tag only for questions which involve programming directly. If you seek general help regarding Microsoft Excel which is not about programming then consider asking your question at SuperUser.com. It is OK to combine the Excel tag with VSTO, C#, VB.NET, PowerShell, OLE automation, and other programming related tags and questions.

Microsoft Office Excel is a spreadsheet application written and distributed by Microsoft for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. It features calculation, graphing tools, pivot tables and a macro programming language called [Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications).

The first Mac version of Excel was introduced in 1985 followed by the first Microsoft Windows version of Excel in 1987\. New versions have typically been released every 2-4 years since then. The latest versions are [Excel 2011 for OS X](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/excel) and [Excel 2013 for Windows](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel). A new user-interface design, dubbed the "ribbon", was introduced with Office 2007 for Windows. A similar UI was introduced to Excel 2011 for OS X.

Excel is currently the widely used spreadsheet program, especially in business environments where it has dominated the spreadsheet market since displacing Lotus 1-2-3 in the early 1990s.
