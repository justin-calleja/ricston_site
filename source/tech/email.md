## About email

Email is a method of exchanging digital messages from a sender to one or more recipients.

Electronic mail, commonly called email or e-mail, is a method of exchanging digital messages from a sender to one or more recipients.

Modern email operates across the Internet or other computer networks. Some early email systems required that the sender and the recipient both be online at the same time - a system currently known as Instant messaging. Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need connect only briefly, typically to an email server, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages.

In other words e-mail is an Internet service that allows those people who have an e-mail address (accounts) to send and receive electronic letters. Those are much like postal letters, except that they are delivered much faster than snail mail when sending over long distances, and are usually free.
