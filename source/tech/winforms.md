WinForms is the informal name given to Windows Forms, the graphical application programming interface (API) included as a part of Microsoft's [.net](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/.net "show questions tagged '.net'") framework, which provides access to the native Microsoft Windows interface elements by wrapping the existing [windows-api](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/windows-api "show questions tagged 'windows-api'") in managed code.<sup>[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms)</sup>

A Windows Forms application is an event-driven application supported by Microsoft's .NET Framework. Unlike a batch program, it spends most of its time simply waiting for the user to do something, such as fill in a text box or click a button.<sup>[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms#Architecture)</sup>

Windows Forms is still supported by Microsoft. In addition to the Microsoft .NET Framework, Windows Forms is available in [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/WinForms).
