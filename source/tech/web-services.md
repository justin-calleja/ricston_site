## About web-services

A "web service" is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over the World Wide Web.

A [web service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service) is an application that responds to requests using a protocol built on top of [HTTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) (see also [http](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/http "show questions tagged 'http'")), the protocol of the World Wide Web. The term can also designate the application protocol itself.

Some web services follow the [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) (representational state transfer - see also [rest](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rest "show questions tagged 'rest'")) principle, where communication takes the form of requests from a client and matching responses from the server, and the server does not keep track of successive requests from a client (no sessions).

The [W3C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C) standardizes [WSDL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language) (see also [wsdl](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wsdl "show questions tagged 'wsdl'")) to describe web service protocols and [SOAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) (see also [soap](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/soap "show questions tagged 'soap'")) to structure messages encoded in [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) (see also [xml](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xml "show questions tagged 'xml'")).
