## About drupal

Drupal is an open source CMS framework written in PHP. Rather than using this tag, consider posting your question directly on http://drupal.stackexchange.com/.

[Drupal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal) is a highly configurable open source Content Management System (CMS), and Web application framework. Questions here can often be answered in a programmatic manner, or through the use of modules and configurations. Backed by a very active developer community, the Drupal official ecosystem currently (April 2015) shows some impressive numbers:

1.  [1316 Themes](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme) - Themes allow you to change the look and feel of your Drupal site. You can use themes contributed by others or create your own to share with the community;
2.  [16,955 Modules](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module) - Extend and customize Drupal functionality with contributed modules;
3.  [496 Distributions](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_distribution) - Distributions, also referred to as installation profiles, provide site features and functions for a specific type of site as a single download containing Drupal core, contributed modules, themes, and pre-defined configuration. They make it possible to quickly set up a complex, use-specific site in fewer steps than if installing and configuring elements individually:
4.  [100+ Translations](https://localize.drupal.org/) - Drupal core is just one of the 15233 projects translated on the official server.

The latest version with official releases is Drupal 7; Drupal 6 is still largely used; Drupal 8 is currently under development, and it is loosely planned for its first official release around 2016\. For more details about it, refer to [Drupal 8 feature freeze: December 1st, 2012](http://buytaert.net/drupal-8-feature-freeze-december-1st-2012).

Drupal questions can also be asked on **#drupal** on the [FreeNode IRC network](http://drupal.org/irc), or on the drupal.org [support forums](http://drupal.org/forum).

**[Drupal Answers](http://drupal.stackexchange.com/) is a dedicated Stack Exchange site for Drupal. You are invited to use it for any questions specific to Drupal which are outside the scope of Stack Overflow.**

Each major release of Drupal is not completely compatible with the previous; hence, the importance of using the version tags (e.g. [drupal-6](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/drupal-6 "show questions tagged 'drupal-6'"), [drupal-7](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/drupal-7 "show questions tagged 'drupal-7'")) whenever appropriate.
