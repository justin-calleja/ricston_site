## About tsql

T-SQL (Transact Structured Query Language) is the extension of SQL functionality supported by Sybase ASE and Microsoft SQL Server.

[T-SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL) (Transact Structured Query Language) is the extension of SQL functionality supported by Sybase ASE and Microsoft SQL Server. They share the name because Microsoft SQL Server was based on Sybase ASE code in a partnership that later dissolved. While the name is shared, functionality is not necessarily identical. With the introduction of Microsoft SQL Server 2005, the SQL Server code was completely re-written to provide integration with .Net.

Transact-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications that communicate with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application.

It adheres to nearly all SQL standards, yet supplies an additional set of functionality not a part of the SQL standard, with concepts such as common table expressions, index hints, and the ability to SELECT scalars.
