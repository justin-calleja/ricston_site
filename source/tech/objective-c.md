## About objective-c

This tag should be used only on questions that are about Objective-C features or depend on code in the language. The tags "cocoa" and "cocoa-touch" should be used to ask about Apple's frameworks or classes. Use the related tags [ios] and [osx] for issues specific to those platforms.

[Objective-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) is an object-oriented programming language combining features of [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C) ([c](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c "show questions tagged 'c'")) and [Smalltalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) ([smalltalk](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/smalltalk "show questions tagged 'smalltalk'")). It is a strict superset of C (any valid C code is equally valid Objective-C code), and it inherits its object-oriented capabilities from Smalltalk. All procedural syntax is identical to that of C, and all object-oriented syntax is an implementation of Smalltalk messaging.

Objective-C was created primarily by [Brad Cox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Cox) and Tom Love in the early 1980s at their company [Stepstone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepstone). It is now primarily developed by [Apple, Inc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.).

Objective-C is a general-purpose, high-level, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. It is the main programming language used by Apple for [osx](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/osx "show questions tagged 'osx'") and [ios](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ios "show questions tagged 'ios'") and their respective APIs, [cocoa](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cocoa "show questions tagged 'cocoa'") and [cocoa-touch](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cocoa-touch "show questions tagged 'cocoa-touch'").

Objective-C inherits the syntax, primitive types, and flow control statements of C and adds syntax for defining classes and methods. It also adds language-level support for object graph management and object literals while providing dynamic typing and binding, deferring many responsibilities until runtime.

# Hello world in Objective C

    #import <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        NSLog(@"Hello, world!\n");
        return 0;
    }

## Syntax

Objective-C is a thin layer on top of C, and moreover is a strict superset of C; it is possible to compile any C program with an Objective-C compiler, and to freely include C code within an Objective-C class. Objective-C derives its object syntax from Smalltalk. All of the syntax for non-object-oriented operations (including primitive variables, pre-processing, expressions, function declarations, and function calls) are identical to that of C, while the syntax for object-oriented features is an implementation of Smalltalk-style messaging.
