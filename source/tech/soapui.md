## About soapui

SoapUI is a desktop application for inspecting, invoking, monitoring, simulating/mocking, and testing of SOAP/WSDL and REST/WADL web services.

[SoapUI](http://soapui.org/About-SoapUI/what-is-soapui.html) is a desktop application for inspecting, invoking, monitoring, simulating/mocking as well as functional testing, security testing, performance & load testing, compliance testing, and surveillance testing of SOAP/WSDL and REST/WADL web services. Besides web-service protocols and standards, it also supports JMS, AMF, JDBC, and other communication mechanisms.

Notable features of SoapUI include (among many):

*   Free open-source and commercial Pro versions.
*   Cross-platform availability, as SoapUI is built entirely on the Java platform using Java Swing for its GUI.
*   Comprehensive test statistics and reports.
*   Plugins for integration with [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.soapui.org/IDE-Plugins/intellij.html), [Eclipse](http://www.soapui.org/IDE-Plugins/eclipse-plugin.html), [NetBeans](http://www.soapui.org/IDE-Plugins/netbeans-plugin.html), and [Maven](http://www.soapui.org/Test-Automation/maven-2x.html), [JUnit integration](http://www.soapui.org/Test-Automation/integrating-with-junit.html), and command-line integration with other tools using [`testrunner.bat`](http://www.soapui.org/Test-Automation/cli-functional-tests.html), [`loadtestrunner.bat`](http://www.soapui.org/Test-Automation/cli-load-tests.html), [`securitytestrunner.bat`](http://www.soapui.org/Test-Automation/cli-security-tests.html) etc.
*   Broad [SOAP/WSDL](http://www.soapui.org/SOAP-and-WSDL/code-generation.html) and [REST/WADL](http://www.soapui.org/REST-Testing/rest-code-generation.html) code generation capabilities.
*   [Extensive scripting support](http://www.soapui.org/Scripting-Properties/scripting-and-the-script-library.html) using Groovy or JavaScript.
*   A [rich Java API](http://www.soapui.org/apidocs/overview-summary.html) that exposes the tool's underpinnings.
