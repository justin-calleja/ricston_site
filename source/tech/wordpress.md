## About wordpress

**[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/)** is a PHP-based, open source content management system ([cms](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cms "show questions tagged 'cms'")) for creating websites and blogs. Through its dynamic presentation of content, webmasters have the flexibility to create beautiful and useful websites easily. Through its system of filters and hooks, WordPress allows developers to extend functionality through pieces of code called functions, which can be grouped into separate executables called "plugins".

WordPress was used by more than [23.3% of the top 10 million websites](http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all/) as of January 2015.

WordPress as a content management platform should be distinguished from [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/), which is a hosted solution by the creators of WordPress. For a discussion of the differences, visit [WordPress.com and WordPress.org](http://en.support.wordpress.com/com-vs-org/). The latest version is WordPress 4.2 “Powell” released April 23, 2015.

This tag is for programming-specific questions related to WordPress, especially those that involve a mix of languages and technologies (PHP, MySQL, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery and others). Questions about plugin and theme development, WordPress administration, management best practices and server configuration are best asked on Stack Exchange [WordPress Development](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/).
