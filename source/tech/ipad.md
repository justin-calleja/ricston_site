## About ipad

iPad is a tablet computer designed by Apple running the iOS operating system. iPad applications are usually written in Objective-C or Swift in the Xcode IDE, although it is also possible to use other tools to build iPad applications. Questions that are not dependent on hardware should use the iOS tag instead.

**iPad** is a tablet computer designed by Apple running the [ios](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ios "show questions tagged 'ios'") operating system. iPad applications are usually written in [objective-c](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/objective-c "show questions tagged 'objective-c'") in the [xcode](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xcode "show questions tagged 'xcode'") IDE, although it's possible to use other tools to build iPad applications as well. Only use [ipad](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ipad "show questions tagged 'ipad'") if you have problems with the hardware itself.

Currently, there are 5 "generations" (yearly updates) of the iPad:

*   iPad
*   iPad 2
*   iPad 3rd generation
*   iPad 4th generation
*   iPad Air (5th generation)
*   iPad Air 2 (6th generation)

There is also a iPad mini which was released at the same time as the 4th generation of the iPad. Besides it, there is a iPad Mini 2 (with retina screen). It was released in 2013 together with iPad Air. For iPad Mini related questions use [ipad-mini](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ipad-mini "show questions tagged 'ipad-mini'").

All iPads aside from the first generation are capable of running iOS 8.3, the current iOS operating system as of April 2015\. The highest supported iOS version for the first generation iPad is iOS 5.1.1\. Another difference between the first generation iPad and the later generations is that the first generation has no camera.
