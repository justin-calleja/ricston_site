## About wpf

Windows Presentation Foundation, or WPF, is a subsystem for rendering user interfaces in Windows-based applications.

**Windows Presentation Foundation** (WPF, previously known as “Avalon”) is part of the Microsoft [.net](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/.net "show questions tagged '.net'") [framework](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/framework "show questions tagged 'framework'") (version 3.0 onwards) used to create rich client user experiences for Windows applications

It features a diverse set of controls, layout options, 2D and 3D graphics, media and text handling and enables data binding and style-driven templates.

It uses a combination of [XAML](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/xaml/info), an [xml](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xml "show questions tagged 'xml'")-based markup language, and any of the [Common Language Runtime languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime) to define user interface elements. A fundamental aspect of **WPF** is to separate the user interface definition from the business logic which enables developers and designers to work concurrently on a single project much more easily. **WPF** also moves UI rendering off to the video hardware through the use of `Direct X`. Doing so allows computers to utilize their GPU, which frees the CPU to handle more of the logic-oriented tasks.

**WPF** runtime libraries are included in all versions of [windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/windows "show questions tagged 'windows'"), since Windows [vista](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vista "show questions tagged 'vista'") and Windows [server2008](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/server2008 "show questions tagged 'server2008'").

`WPF` employs [xaml](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xaml "show questions tagged 'xaml'"), an XML-based language, to define and link various UI elements. WPF applications can also be deployed as standalone desktop programs, or hosted as an embedded object in a website. WPF aims to unify a number of common user interface elements, such as 2D/3D rendering, fixed and adaptive documents, typography, vector graphics, runtime animation, and pre-rendered media. These elements can then be linked and manipulated based on various events, user interactions, and data bindings.

[microsoft](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/microsoft "show questions tagged 'microsoft'") has released five major WPF versions: WPF 3.0 (Nov 2006), WPF 3.5 (Nov 2007), WPF 3.5sp1 (Aug 2008), WPF 4 (April 2010), and WPF 4.5 (August 2012).
