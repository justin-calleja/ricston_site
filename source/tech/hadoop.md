## About Hadoop

Hadoop is an Apache open-source project that provides software for reliable and scalable distributed computing. The project itself includes a variety of other complementary additions.

The [Apache™ Hadoop™](https://hadoop.apache.org/) project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing.

"[Hadoop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop)" typically refers to the software in the project that implements the [map-reduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) data analysis framework, plus the distributed file system (HDFS) that underlies it.

Since version 0.23, Hadoop disposes of a standalone resource manager : [yarn](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html).

This resource manager makes it easier to use other modules alongside with the MapReduce engine, such as :

*   [Ambari](https://ambari.apache.org/), A web-based tool for provisioning, managing, and  
     monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters which includes support for Hadoop  
     HDFS, Hadoop MapReduce, Hive, HCatalog, HBase, ZooKeeper, Oozie, Pig and Sqoop. Ambari also provides a dashboard for viewing cluster  
     health such as heatmaps and ability to view MapReduce, Pig and Hive  
     applications visually along with features to diagnose their  
     performance characteristics in a user-friendly manner.
*   [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/), a data serialization system based on JSON schemas.
*   [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/), a replicated, fault-tolerant, decentralized and scalable database system.
*   [Chukwa](https://chukwa.apache.org/): A data collection system for managing large distributed systems.
*   [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/), A scalable, distributed database that supports structured data storage for large tables.
*   [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/), A data warehouse infrastructure that provides data summarization and ad hoc querying.
*   [Mahout](https://mahout.apache.org/), a library of machine learning algorithms compatible with M/R paradigm.
*   [Pig](https://pig.apache.org/), a platform/programming language for authoring parallelizable jobs
*   [Storm](https://storm.apache.org/), a system for real-time and stream processing
*   [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/), a system for coordinating distributed nodes, similar to Google's Chubby
*   [Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org/), a workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs.
*   [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing.
*   [Flink](http://flink.apache.org/), a fast and reliable large-scale data processing engine.
