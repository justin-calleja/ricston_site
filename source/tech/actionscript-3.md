## About actionscript-3

ActionScript 3 (AS3) is the open source object oriented programming (OOP) language of the Adobe Flash and AIR Platforms. AS3 is widely used for RIAs, mobile apps, and desktop applications. (ActionScript 3 is a dialect of ECMAScript.)

ActionScript 3 (AS3), developed by Adobe, is an open source, object-oriented programming (OOP) language. It is a dialect of ECMAScript.

AS3 can be used to create web programs deployed using Flash Player, applications for iOS, Android, Blackberry (PlayBook OS and BlackBerry 10), and desktop using Adobe AIR, as well as TV applications using Adobe AIR for TV.

ActionScript is an object-oriented language originally developed by Macromedia Inc. (now owned by Adobe Systems). It is a dialect of ECMAScript (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as JavaScript), and is used primarily for the development of websites and software targeting the Adobe Flash Player platform, used on Web pages in the form of embedded SWF files. The language itself is open-source in that its specification is offered free of charge and both an open source compiler (as part of Apache Flex) and open source virtual machine (Mozilla Tamarin) are available.
