[Software design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design) is a process of problem solving and planning for a software solution. After the purpose and specifications of software are determined, software developers will design or employ designers to develop a plan for a solution. It includes low-level component and algorithm implementation issues as well as the architectural view.

[Software design documentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_document) may be reviewed or presented to allow constraints, specifications and even requirements to be adjusted prior to computer programming. Redesign may occur after review of a programmed simulation or prototype.
