## About facebook

Facebook Platform lets developers integrate their apps directly into the Facebook social networking service. Use this tag for questions which may arise when developing FOR Facebook. This tag is NOT for support questions about using the Facebook website or the official Facebook app.

The [Facebook Platform](http://developers.facebook.com) is a software environment provided by the social networking service Facebook for third-party developers to [create their own applications](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/) and services that access data in Facebook. It lets developers integrate their applications directly into the Facebook social networking service.

The platform offers a set of programming interfaces and tools which enable developers to integrate with the "open graph" of personal relations and other things like songs, places, and Facebook pages. Applications on facebook.com, external websites, and devices are all allowed to access the graph. Launched on May 24, 2007, Facebook Platform has evolved from enabling development just on facebook.com to one also supporting integration across the web and devices.
