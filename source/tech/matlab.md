## About matlab

MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive programming environment for numerical computation and visualization developed by MathWorks.

**[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)** (**mat**rix **lab**oratory) is a high-level language and interactive programming environment for numerical computation and visualization developed by [MathWorks](http://www.mathworks.com/). MATLAB can be used when performing tasks such as signal processing and communications, image and video processing, computational finance, and computational biology. It is the foundation for a number of other tools, including [Simulink](http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/) and [various toolboxes](http://www.mathworks.com/products/product_listing/index.html) that extend its core capabilities.

[MATLAB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB) is a cross-platform system, developed since 1984\. Since the release of version 7.2 (R2006a) there is a semestral release cycle (e.g. R2013a and R2013b came approximately 6 months apart). Based on [release history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB#Release_history), new versions are typically released in March/April ("a") and September/October ("b").
