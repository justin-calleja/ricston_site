## About algorithm

An algorithm is a sequence of well-defined steps that defines an abstract solution to a problem. Use this tag when your issue is related to algorithm design.

An algorithm is a set of ordered instructions based on a formal language with the following conditions:

*   **Finite**. The number of instructions must be finite.
*   **Executable**. All instructions must be executable in some language-dependent way, in a finite amount of time.
*   **Deterministic**. The algorithm must be predictable.

An algorithm can be expressed in many ways: as a sequence of instructions; as a block-scheme; as a code in an existing or new programming language; as a piece of text in a human language; or in other, similar ways.

An algorithm can solve a class of problems. For example, both "sum 1 and 3" and "sum 4 and 5" are problems in the same class: "sum two integer numbers." Furthermore, a given class of problems can generally be solved by a variety of algorithms.

One important aspect of algorithm design is performance. For large datasets a good algorithm may outperform a poor algorithm by several orders of magnitude. Algorithm performance is often rated with [Big O or Î˜ notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), but one should be cautious with asymptotic notation, since big constants may be involved.

A key algorithm classification is known as [Algorithm Complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory).
