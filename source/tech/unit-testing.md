## About unit-testing

Unit testing is a method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine if they are fit for use.

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing):

> Unit testing is a method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine if they are fit for use. Intuitively, one can view a unit as the smallest testable part of an application. In procedural programming a unit could be an entire module but is more commonly an individual function or procedure. In object-oriented programming a unit is often an entire interface, such as a class, but could be an individual method. Unit tests are created by programmers or occasionally by white box testers during the development process.

Unit tests are typically written and run by software developers to ensure that code meets its design and behaves as intended.<sup>[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)</sup>

Unit testing is closely related to [Test Driven Development](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment).
