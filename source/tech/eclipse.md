## About eclipse

Eclipse is an open source IDE and platform for building applications. There is a wide variety of plugins for various programming languages and other development-oriented tools (such as modeling, database browsing, etc.). This tag should only be used for questions specifically about the Eclipse IDE or platform, not for generalized (Java, Android, etc.) programming topics.

**[Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)** is an [open-source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/open-source "show questions tagged 'open-source'") [ide](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ide "show questions tagged 'ide'") [platform](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/platform "show questions tagged 'platform'") written mostly in [java](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java "show questions tagged 'java'") and primarily used for Java development through the use of the [Java Development Tools](https://www.eclipse.org/jdt/) (JDT) plugin. It is notable for its rich ecosystem of free and commercial [plugins](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/plugins "show questions tagged 'plugins'").

Eclipse uses [osgi](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/osgi "show questions tagged 'osgi'") internally and has a built-in `OSGI` implementation called [equinox](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/equinox "show questions tagged 'equinox'"); the same `OSGI`-based framework is used for its plugins. Eclipse has many standard plugins that can be used as an eclipse-like application development platform - this set of plugins is called [eclipse-rcp](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/eclipse-rcp "show questions tagged 'eclipse-rcp'").

For [c](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c "show questions tagged 'c'")/[c++](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b "show questions tagged 'c++'") development, the [Eclipse CDT Project](https://www.eclipse.org/cdt/) provides a plugin to create a `C/C++` development environment within Eclipse.

For [php](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php "show questions tagged 'php'") and web development, the [Eclipse PDT Project](https://www.eclipse.org/pdt/) provides a plugin to create a `PHP` development environment within Eclipse. The popular commercial [zend-studio](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/zend-studio "show questions tagged 'zend-studio'") is also based on Eclipse.

For [python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python "show questions tagged 'python'") development, the [PyDev project](http://pydev.org/) provides a plugin to create a [python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python "show questions tagged 'python'") development environment within Eclipse.

For [perl](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/perl "show questions tagged 'perl'") development, the [EPIC](http://www.epic-ide.org/) project provides a plugin to create a [perl](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/perl "show questions tagged 'perl'") development environment within Eclipse.

For [![](//i.stack.imgur.com/tKsDb.png)android](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/android "show questions tagged 'android'") development, the [Android Development Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html) provide a plugin to create an [![](//i.stack.imgur.com/tKsDb.png)android](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/android "show questions tagged 'android'") development environment within Eclipse.

When combined with [cygwin](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cygwin "show questions tagged 'cygwin'") (or [mingw](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mingw "show questions tagged 'mingw'")), [mono](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mono "show questions tagged 'mono'"), and its many plugins, Eclipse provides a crucial part of viable [open-source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/open-source "show questions tagged 'open-source'") alternatives to using Microsoft [visual-studio](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/visual-studio "show questions tagged 'visual-studio'") as a [windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/windows "show questions tagged 'windows'") software development platform in Windows, whilst also including comprehensive native support for [java](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java "show questions tagged 'java'").

Within the Stack Overflow community, Eclipse is synonymous with the Java IDE, but that does not mean questions about Java are questions about the IDE.

Consider what changes your question would require if you were using `vi` to edit and `ant` to build; if your question would remain unchanged, then it is not an Eclipse question, so you should not give your question the [eclipse](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/eclipse "show questions tagged 'eclipse'") tag. Use the [java](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java "show questions tagged 'java'") tag instead.
