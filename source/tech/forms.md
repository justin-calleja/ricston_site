## About forms

A form is essentially a container that can be used to hold any amount of any subset of several types of data. HTML forms are used to pass data to a server. VB and C# forms are the windows used to interact with the user.

A form contains elements which are inputs and outputs.

These inputs may include text fields, checkboxes, radio-buttons, submit buttons, hidden inputs (hidden from the agent filling the form) and more.

A web form element also is characterized by the action that will be undertaken **on submit** and the method used to make the request (HTTP GET or POST).

VB and C# forms are the windows used to interact with the user.

Standard [html](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html "show questions tagged 'html'") form declaration is,

    <form action="form_action" method="submit_method">
    .
    {input elements, here you can declare any html 
     tag and all you input fields that can be text fields, 
     checkboxes, radio-buttons, submit buttons and more }
    .
    </form>
