Data validation is the process of ensuring that a program operates on clean, correct and useful data. It applies rules or constraints to check for correctness, meaningfulness, and security of data that are input to the system.

The most common reasons for validation are to avoid entering data which violates a database schema, and to prevent unauthorized exploitation of a user interface.
