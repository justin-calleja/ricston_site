HTML ([HyperText Markup Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)) is the main markup language (similar to [xml](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xml "show questions tagged 'xml'")) for creating web pages and other information to be displayed in a web browser. It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN to enable researchers to share their findings. The latest version for HTML is [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5), which supports many new features.

HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. It can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages. All the web pages that are written in different programming languages (PHP, JSP, VF etc.) get rendered as HTML on the browser.

### Syntax

HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags (and their attributes) enclosed in angle brackets (like `<html>`), within the web page content. Angle brackets are also referred to as left & right guillemets or chevrons.

HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like `<h1>` and `</h1>`, although some tags, known as empty elements, are unpaired, for example `<img>`, these are usually closed by putting a `/` at the end (Ex. `<img src='image.jpg'/>`). The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags). In between these tags authors can add text, tags, comments and other types of text-based content.

The purpose of a web browser is to read HTML documents and compose them into visible or audible web pages. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses the tags to interpret the content of the page.

### Standards

HTML standards, as well as those for many other web technologies, are maintained by the [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/) ([w3c](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/w3c "show questions tagged 'w3c'")).

[html4](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html4 "show questions tagged 'html4'") was introduced in 1997, and the latest iteration, [html5](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html5 "show questions tagged 'html5'") was recently developed by the W3C. What W3C calls _HTML5_ is a subset of the HTML-Living-Standard which is specified by the [Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group](http://www.whatwg.org/) (WHATWG).

The language specification and standards documents for HTML5 are available online [here](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/).
