## About flex

Apache Flex is a framework for developing Rich Internet Applications that run in Flash Player or Adobe Air; for the lexical analyzer *flex* use the tag flex-lexer instead; also for the CSS `flex` property use the tag flexbox instead.

**[Flex](http://flex.apache.org/)** is a framework for rapid Rich Internet Application development which runs on Flash Player or Adobe [air](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/air "show questions tagged 'air'"). Originally designed by Adobe, Flex was donated to the Apache Software Foundation in 2011 and became a top level Apache project in December 2012.

Apache Flex® is a highly productive, open source application framework for building and maintaining expressive web applications that deploy consistently on all major browsers, desktops and devices (including smartphones, tablets and tv). It provides a modern, standards-based language and programming model that supports common design patterns suitable for developers from many backgrounds. Flex applications can be deployed to the ubiquitous Adobe® Flash® Player in the browser, Adobe® AIR™ on desktop and mobile or to native Android™, IOS™, QNX®, Windows® or Mac® applications.<sup>[1](http://flex.apache.org/)</sup>

*   The CSS property `flex` is also not related to this. It should be tagged with [flexbox](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flexbox "show questions tagged 'flexbox'") instead.
